## AI based IOT Smart Water quality detection in home water purifier

##### According to the World Health Organization, more than 2 billion people are still being affected by contaminated water. And while we think itâ€™s safe in the United States, the Flint, Michigan water crisis has proven to us that even in first world country like the US, we still face water safety issues. In india water quality monitoring is a big issue so we built an AI and IoT based water quality monitoring system.

##### Traditional method

Currently all of the water sensors are chemical based, the most common one being using chemical test strips that are one time use. Making monitoring contamination extremely difficult and exhausting, hence events like Flint, MI have happened in the past.

The method of detection

Clean Water AI is an IoT device that classifies and detects dangerous bacteria and harmful particles. The system can run continuously in real time. The cities can install IoT devices across different water sources and they will be able to monitor water quality as well as contamination continuously.


###### 1 Low cost smart water TDS sensing device at water source level and water output level of water purifier.

2. This Solution will work for retrofit for existing above water purifier as well as new home water purifier.

3. IOT based smart solution with android app for end consumer and home water purifier service provider.

 4. This system is affordable for end consumer and preferably integrated into the home water purifier service provider.

5.When moving from one location to another location, if the input water quality is changes then end consumer and home water purifier service provider will get a  alert notification .
